<h1>About <span>Gerrie Diaz</span></h1>

![example image](/images/IMG_1375.jpeg "Barceloneta with W Hotel in the background.")

<p>I love to build technology that connects people and positively impacts society. My interests include: Product Management, Design, Sports, Pschology, and Accessibility.</p>

<h2>Curiosity</h2>
<p>I am intrigued by how humans (and animals) think and how complex systems can be decomposed into simpler parts. Complexity exists all around us and I tend to dig at least one level deeper, usually via claryfing questions, in order to make well-informed decisions - especially Type 1 Decisions (see "Jeff Bezos: There are two types of decisions to make, and don't confuse them.")</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>I love to riff on ideas with others in order to surface different perspectives (see "Diverge then Converge"). I am a firm believer that without diversity, teams can succumb to groupthink rather quickly.

<p>Not many things in this world can be done in isolation. If you are a one-person shop, a rockstar engineer, AND a stellar designer, you still need to collaborate with your customers!</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>
<p>Nothing is truly "perfect." In the world of sofware, it behooves us not to seek perfect but to build & deliver frequently in order to maintain constant feedback loops. I love to operate as lean as possible so we don't end up with the Tree Swing Cartoon.</p>
